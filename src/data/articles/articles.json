    "description": "Discover what security misconfiguration means, why it puts your systems at risk, and how to avoid common configuration mistakes to secure your web applications. Security misconfiguration occurs when security settings in your web servers, applications, databases, or networks are incorrect or incomplete. This leaves systems vulnerable to attacks. It is one of the most common issues in web security and can happen at any level of an application stack.",

Unlike bugs or coding errors, insecure design problems come from poor or missing security controls during the early stages of development.This means that even if the code is written correctly, the overall system may still be vulnerable because the design did not consider security risks properly.",

    "description": "Understand what injection attacks are, how they happen, and how to prevent them. This guide explains OWASP Top 10's #3 most dangerous web security risk. Injection attacks happen when untrusted data is sent to a program or database as part of a command or query. If the system fails to properly handle or filter this input, the attacker can trick it into running harmful code. The most common type is SQL Injection, but there are others like Command Injection, LDAP Injection, and XML Injection. These attacks can lead to stolen data, data loss, or complete system compromise.",

Cryptographic failures happen when sensitive data is not properly protected using encryption. This used to be called 'Sensitive Data Exposure' in older OWASP lists. In simple terms, if your website or app stores, sends, or receives private data (like passwords, credit cards, or personal info) without proper security, it’s at risk. Attackers can steal or tamper with the data if it's not encrypted or if outdated encryption methods are used.",

This guide explains what it is, why it’s dangerous, common examples, and how to prevent it—all in simple language. Broken Access Control happens when a web application fails to properly restrict what users are allowed to do.
