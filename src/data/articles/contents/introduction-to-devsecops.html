            <p style="color: #222222; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">DevSecOps integrates security into every stage of
                the software development lifecycle, making security a shared responsibility among development,
                operations, and security teams. By automating security testing, vulnerability scanning, and compliance
                checks early and continuously, it helps identify and fix risks faster. This approach fosters
                collaboration, accelerates delivery, and ensures secure, reliable software in dynamic environments.
                DevSecOps shifts security left, reducing costly fixes after deployment and promoting a culture of
                proactive security awareness throughout the entire development and operations process.</p>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 14px;">
                <h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 6px;">1. Why is it important to develop secure applications?
                </h3>
                <div style="padding-left: 10px;">
                    <p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px;">To control risk and help protect against security vulnerabilities
                        and threats.</p>
                    <p style="color: #555555; font-size: 13px; margin: 0px;">Developing secure applications is crucial
                        because it helps control risks by preventing security vulnerabilities that attackers could
                        exploit. This protection safeguards sensitive data, ensures system reliability, and maintains
                        user trust. Building security into applications from the start reduces potential damage, legal
                        issues, and costly fixes later on.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 6px;">2. At which phase, in the software development
                    lifecycle, should threat modeling be performed?</h3>
                <div style="padding-left: 10px;">
                    <p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px;">Design phase</p>
                    <p style="color: #555555; font-size: 13px; margin: 0px;">Threat modeling should be performed during
                        the design phase of the software development lifecycle. This allows teams to identify potential
                        security risks early, plan appropriate defenses, and build secure architecture before coding
                        begins, reducing vulnerabilities and costly fixes later.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 6px;">3. How can the security team help application
                    developers or DevOps?</h3>
                <div style="padding-left: 10px;">
                    <p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px;">They help application developers and the DevOps team to understand
                        threats, evaluate security tools, advise on remediation practices, and write tests.</p>
                    <p style="color: #555555; font-size: 13px; margin: 0px;">The security team supports application
                        developers and DevOps by helping them understand potential threats, evaluating and recommending
                        security tools, advising on best remediation practices, and assisting in writing security tests.
                        This collaboration ensures security is integrated effectively throughout development and
                        deployment.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 6px;">4. What is the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)?
                </h3>
                <div style="padding-left: 10px;">
                    <p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px;">It is a framework that specifies the steps involved in software
                        development at each stage.</p>
                    <p style="color: #555555; font-size: 13px; margin: 0px;">The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
                        is a framework that defines the structured steps and processes involved in developing software.
                        It guides teams through stages like planning, designing, coding, testing, deployment, and
                        maintenance to ensure efficient, high-quality, and reliable software delivery.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 6px;">5. Why is striving for failure beneficial?</h3>
                <div style="padding-left: 10px;">
                    <p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px;">It promotes the development of a more secure application.</p>
                    <p style="color: #555555; font-size: 13px; margin: 0px;">Striving for failure is beneficial because
                        it encourages identifying weaknesses and vulnerabilities early. By intentionally testing and
                        exposing flaws, teams can strengthen security measures, leading to the development of more
                        resilient and secure applications.</p>
