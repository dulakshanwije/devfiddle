        <h2>What Are Injection Attacks?</h2>
        <p>
            Injection attacks happen when untrusted data is sent to a program or database as part of a command or query.
            If the system fails to properly handle or filter this input, the attacker can trick it into running harmful
            code.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most common type is <strong>SQL Injection</strong>, but there are others like <strong>Command
                Injection</strong>, <strong>LDAP Injection</strong>, and <strong>XML Injection</strong>. These attacks
            can lead to stolen data, data loss, or complete system compromise.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Are Injection Attacks Dangerous?</h2>
        <p>
            Injection attacks can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expose sensitive data like usernames, passwords, or credit cards</li>
            <li>Allow attackers to bypass login systems</li>
            <li>Let hackers delete or modify your data</li>
            <li>In some cases, give full control of the server to attackers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These are serious risks that can affect both small websites and large organizations.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Examples of Injection</h2>

        <h3>1. SQL Injection (SQLi)</h3>
        <p>
            An attacker enters SQL code into a form field or URL to access or manipulate a database.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example:
            <code>' OR '1'='1</code> can trick a login form into granting access without a valid password.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Command Injection</h3>
        <p>
            The attacker injects operating system commands through a vulnerable application. This can allow remote code
            execution.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h3>
        <p>
            Though technically a different category, it is similar in that malicious code is injected into a page and
            run in the browser.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Prevent Injection Attacks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use prepared statements (parameterized queries):</strong> This stops user input from being
                treated as code.</li>
            <li><strong>Use ORM frameworks:</strong> Like Django ORM or Hibernate to handle database queries securely.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Validate and sanitize all input:</strong> Ensure user input meets expected format and remove
                harmful characters.</li>
            <li><strong>Use stored procedures carefully:</strong> Avoid dynamic SQL inside stored procedures.</li>
            <li><strong>Least privilege access:</strong> Databases should not run with admin-level permissions unless
                necessary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Real-World Example</h2>
        <p>
            In 2012, a major tech company suffered a SQL injection attack that exposed over 450,000 user accounts. The
            attacker used a simple URL-based injection to pull user emails and passwords from the database. The breach
            was highly public and damaging to the company’s reputation.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            Injection attacks are easy to launch but can be devastating if successful. Fortunately, they are also
            preventable. By using secure coding practices and properly handling user input, developers can eliminate the
            risk of injection and protect both their applications and their users.
