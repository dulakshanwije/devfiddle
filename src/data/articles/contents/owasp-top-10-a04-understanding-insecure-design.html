            Explore what insecure design means in web security, why it’s a major risk, and how to build safer
            applications from the start with secure design principles.

    <section>
        <h2>What Is Insecure Design?</h2>
        <p>
            Insecure design refers to flaws or weaknesses in the way an application or system is planned and built.
            Unlike bugs or coding errors, insecure design problems come from poor or missing security controls during
            the early stages of development.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means that even if the code is written correctly, the overall system may still be vulnerable because
            the design did not consider security risks properly.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Is Insecure Design Dangerous?</h2>
        <p>
            Insecure design can lead to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Exposure of sensitive data</li>
            <li>Bypassing of authentication or authorization controls</li>
            <li>Weaknesses that attackers can exploit repeatedly</li>
            <li>Expensive fixes late in the development cycle</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Fixing insecure design issues after deployment is often costly and difficult, which is why prevention is
            critical.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Causes of Insecure Design</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of threat modeling or security reviews during design</li>
            <li>Ignoring security best practices or standards</li>
            <li>Overlooking user input validation and access controls</li>
            <li>Failing to plan for secure data storage and transmission</li>
            <li>Assuming security will be added later in development</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Prevent Insecure Design</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apply Threat Modeling:</strong> Identify risks early by imagining how attackers might exploit
                your design.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow Security Principles:</strong> Use principles like least privilege, defense in depth, and
                secure defaults.</li>
            <li><strong>Include Security Experts:</strong> Involve security teams in design reviews and planning.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Secure Design Frameworks:</strong> Adopt established guidelines and patterns for building
                secure apps.</li>
            <li><strong>Test Early and Often:</strong> Perform security testing and code reviews during development, not
                just at the end.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Real-World Example</h2>
        <p>
            Many data breaches have occurred because applications lacked proper design controls. For instance, an
            e-commerce site without proper access controls in its design allowed customers to view other users’ orders
            simply by changing URL parameters.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            Secure design is the foundation of strong application security. Building security into the architecture and
            planning phases reduces risks and saves time and money later. Developers and teams should prioritize secure
            design to create safer, more reliable software.
